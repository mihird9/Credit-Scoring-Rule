# Credit-Scoring-Rule
Statistical Models to develop credit scoring rule for new applicants | R

#### Dataset
The German Credit dataset has data on 1000 past credit applicants, described by 30 variables. Each applicant is also rated as “Good” or “Bad” credit (encoded as 1 and 0 respectively in the Response variable). The GermanCredit.xls file contains the variable descriptions and the data. New applicants for credit can be evaluated on these 30 variables. 

#### Problem Statement
We would like to develop a credit scoring rule that can be used to help determine whether a new applicant presents a good or bad credit risk.

#### Analysis and Statistical Models:
* Exploratory data analysis
* Decision Trees (CART)
* Random Forest
* Logistic Regression
